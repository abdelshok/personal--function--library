# Personal Function Library

This github repo is going to be holding various different functions, patterns, styles, etc. that are often re-used across applications. This is done for the obvious purpose of accelerating the process of development, etching away the repeated code and simplistic patterns, in order to allow me to focus on the more interesting and novel aspects of website design, creation, and back-end development.

## Addendum

In addition to functions, classes, and other types of entities, I'll also list here a number of platforms and useful websites.

### Optimization

These resources should be used before and throughout the deployment of a website, in order to ensure minimum load times, high security, and therefore, maximum conversions.

- [Optimize SVGs](https://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser)
- [Test Load Time & Website Security ](https://testmysite.io/) (Provided by Netlify)
- [Use JSHintt to lint code]()
- After lint issues, use [Google Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/) to minify

### Marketing

### Y Combinator

Collection of good articles, important to read as an engineer, person, and potential founder.

I'll list them here, for myself, with potential comments. More importantly, I'll also make sure to list them here for any random onlooker that wants 

* [How to plan for MVP](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp)
* [Biggest Mistakes Co-Founders Make](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/66-biggest-mistakes-first-time-founders-make)
    * Solving a problem you don't car eabout
    * Helping users you don't care about
    * Choosing cofounders you don't know well
    * Not having transparent conversations wiht cofounder
    * Not launching (unless heavy MVP)
    * Not using analytics (you know it)
    * Not knowing where first users will come from
    * Poor prioritization
* [How to split Equity between cofounders](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5x-how-to-split-equity-among-co-founders)
    * More equity = more motivation
    * Takes 7 to 10 years to build a company, small variations first year doesn't justify equity differences.
    * Startup is about execution, not the idea. No need to giveundue preference to co-foudner who came up with idea, as opposed to small group who got product to market.
* [Order of Operations for starting a Startup](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/61-order-of-operations-for-starting-a-startup)
    * Particular problem you're interested about? Prob can come from experience growing up, personal interest, school, work. 
    * Find some friends and braistorm potential solutions to the problem. Pick people that are fun to brainstorm with, not that reject potential soutions. You need to have that spark. People who also brainstorm feel more ownership over solution, which helps later on.
    * Turn spark into a fucking fire. Work teotgether and build anMVP. resist temptation to build complete solution. Build stripped down version and see whether users actually want to use it. 
    * **Addendum**: Good investors are interested in teams currently in process of executing their idea and tend to shy away from teams that are just pitching their idea.
